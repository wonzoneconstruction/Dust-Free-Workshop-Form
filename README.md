Each of the above three forms of <a href="https://www.wonzonecn.com/news/industry-news/dust-free-purification-workshop-design-how-much-is.html"/>dust-free workshop design</a> has its advantages and disadvantages. Baycliase type and ballroom type dust-free workshops are commonly used in IC pre-process factories. Baycliase type dust-free workshops are widely used in 5","6"IC factories, and their process equipment is wall-through type: However, open dust-free workshop and mini-environment are widely used in 8"and 12" IC factories. The remarkable advantage of ballroom dust-free workshop is that it brings maximum flexibility to process layout, which is particularly important. Because IC production technology is developing very rapidly nowadays, both product requirements and process and production equipment are constantly changing. It usually takes about a year and a half to design and install process equipment in the construction cycle of IC production plants. During this period, the production technology and process are not ready to be adjusted and updated continuously. Only in this way can we ensure that the production technology will be in a backward position when it is put into production. Even after putting into production, the production line will need to be reformed to adjust the product and production capacity because of the changes of product, market and production technology.
